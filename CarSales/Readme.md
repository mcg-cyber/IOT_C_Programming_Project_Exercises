Explanation:
Data Storage: The program uses a CSV file (car_sales.csv) to store car information. Each row represents a car with its details.

Functions:

load_cars(): Loads car data from the CSV file into the cars array.

save_cars(): Saves the cars array back to the CSV file.

add_car(): Prompts the user to input car details and appends the car to the array and file.

print_profit_report(): Sorts cars by profit (descending) and prints a report.

print_sell_time_report(): Sorts cars by sell time (ascending) and prints a report.

Date Handling: The date_diff() function calculates the difference in days between two dates.

Sorting: The qsort() function is used to sort cars based on profit and sell time.

Usage:
Compile and run the program.

Use the menu to add cars, generate reports, or exit.
